Assignment 2 COP 4520 Created by: Mari Peele Language: C++ 

Compile Instructions g++ -O2 *.cpp -o MinotaurParty.exe

For this assignment I combined problems 1 and 2 into one party. Guests arrive at the party, follow the Minotaur's rules making a plan and not talking after starting the game. Each guest makes a decision on whether or not to end the game based on how many full plates they have viewed. While they are waiting to enter the labyrinth they can visit the showroom using the rules from strategy 2.
